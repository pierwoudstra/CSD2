## Main focus

With this project I put the focus on synthesis. In the beginning by making wave-table oscillators and then later envelopes for amplitude and pitch. My favorite synth is the kick synth which I could make using a pitch envelope and the hyperbolic tangent function for soft-clipping.

## Process

I started off wanting to make a playable synthesizer, through the keyboard or MIDI but didn't yet understand how this would work with threading or even how audio gets sent to the driver. Because of this first I chose to focus on the synthesis and generating wave-tables for efficiency. I got that idea from the book 'Elements of Computer Music' by F. Richard Moore.

Most of the time after that I spent trying to understand classes and trying to connect the oscillators & envelopes in different ways. Just before the last week I couldn't work on it anymore for a while so when I started again programming in C++ took some getting used to.

Now I didn't have a lot of time left but I did have three synthesizers so I decided to make a very simple app that makes use of the kick synth I had already made. This is why I called it the Gabber Remix Synth, because right now it doesn't generate new melodies but it does remix existing ones.

## Reflection

Generally I am happy with the end result, mostly the synthesis went well I think. I was a bit dissapointed that it is not a playable synth but there just is a lot to learn and if I just go along in the process eventually I will be able to do that. Maybe even using different technologies but the same skills, something like JUCE, where the Callback works similarly but MIDI is already in the library.

This project took probably around 16 hours or more because I could gradually build all of the components used in the final project.
